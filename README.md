# Brain Tumour MRI Classification
Fundamentals of Medical Image Processing (on Brain Tumour MRI Dataset)

This project presents an end-to-end deep learning solution for the classification of brain MRI images into four clinically relevant categories: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor. The workflow is grounded in the Kaggle “Brain Tumor MRI Dataset” by Masoud Nickparvar and implements a series of professional image processing, augmentation, and explainability techniques. The objective is to demonstrate a reproducible, robust, and interpretable computer vision pipeline suitable for medical image analysis.
